- Grace is going to change the logo going forward - more of an outline. More specific - more like the first.

- No borders around the title bars. 

- Finding a font. Grace will sort this out. 

- No text on the homepage, probably just images. 

- Automatic slideshow with porportional images. Maybe a spread - Fading images.

- The zine - 75% current size - all bars on the same screen. More obvious buttons.
Arrow buttons? Where have they

- 2048 and 1365


November 7th:

Priorities 

- Publication page: This is the page she wants present for her assignment so this needs to ne 100 % smick

- Mobile view: While this is less important it will be viewed on classmates phones on the day so it will have to be at least usable.

- Code clean up and accesiblity: This is absolutely secondary as she will not be graded on this. If it's not a satisfactory standard by Thursday this needs to be completed in the following week.

Saturday - 10 am to 1:30 pm

Tasks:

Scope out total work to be done and potentional road blocks. Everything is very doable but it also hinges on getting the content you are missing from Grace.

Mobile view and figuring out why the images take so long to load seem to be paramount

Sunday 10 am - 6 pm
