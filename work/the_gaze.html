            <p>
              ‘The Gaze’ was a project that began at the start of 2019 in partnership with fellow RMIT student, Caitlin De Vos, during a collaborative studio between Media and Fashion students.

              <br>
              Heavily inspired by the essay ’Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ by Laura Mulvey in 1989, through this film we aimed to provoke a deeper understanding of the unassuming male gaze and the impact it can have on women in their daily lives. The film was entered into several short film festivals at the end of 2019, placing in both the Unscene films festival and RUSU film festival for RMIT where it placed second. The film increased my experience in costume design, film production, scheduling, casting and using programs such as Premiere Pro and Final cut. </p>
