        <p>
          My name is Grace Dawson and I am a Fashion Design graduate based in Melbourne, recently completing the Bachelor of Fashion (Design) (Honours) course at RMIT University. My experience lies in the proficient use of industry-standard design software, garment construction, material manipulation and conceptual design.

          My work approaches fashion and design in a more conceptual manner, exploring the potential for thought-provoking fashion outcomes in contemporary fashion practice. The research field that drives my work typically surrounds our understanding and experience of gender and identity through dress.

          This website showcases my work from my past four years of study at RMIT, experimenting with new ways of approaching fashion and design.
